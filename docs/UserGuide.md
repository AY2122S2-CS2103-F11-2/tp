TAlent Assistant™ is a **desktop, lightweight and centralized management system** catered to professors for managing
the interview scheduling process of candidates applying to be undergraduate Teaching Assistants (TA). 
Professors will be able to access the candidates’ application data easily and review their general availability for 
scheduling interviews during office hours.
TAlent Assistant™ is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a 
Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, this application will be able to help you manage all things under the hood of the TA initiative 
faster than traditional GUI applications.

* [Scheduling interviews](#scheduling-interviews)
* [Miscellaneous commands](#miscellaneous-commands)
* [Processing data](#processing-data)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/82341234 p/86785678`, only `p/86785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Optional parameters for commands are represented with `[` and `]`.<br>
  e.g. `[ATTRIBUTE_FIELD/VALUE]`.

* The following table lists some common abbreviations used in the command prefixes or `ATTRIBUTE_FIELD`s.

| Abbreviation(s)     | Refer(s) to        |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| `is` or `intstatus` | interview status   |
| `as` or `appstatus` | application status |
| `yr`                | seniority          |
| `avail`             | availability       |

Format: `help`

## Managing candidates

### Adding a candidate: `add`

Format: `add id/STUDENT_ID n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL c/COURSE yr/SENIORITY avail/AVAILABILITY`

* `STUDENT_ID` is sensitive and it will be validated.
* `NAME` should only contain alphabets, `A-Z` or `a-z`.

* `COURSE` should only be Computing courses. e.g. Business Analytics, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Information Security, Information Systems
* `SENIORITY` is a number range from 1 to 4.
* `AVAILABILITY` is an input to represent the available days. e.g. `1,2,3` corresponds to available on `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`

### Editing a candidate: `edit`

Edits a candidate in the system.

Format: `edit INDEX [PREFIX/VALUE] [MORE_PREFIX/VALUE]...`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the edit format:**<br>

`PREFIX` can take on the following values `id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, `course`, `yr`, `as`, `avail`

### Listing all candidates : `list`

Displays all candidates found in the system.

Format: `list`

### Finding candidates by keyword(s) search: `find`

Finds and lists candidates whose attribute field(s) contain(s) any of the given keyword(s).

Format: `find k/KEYWORD [k/MORE_KEYWORDS]... [f/ATTRIBUTE_FIELD]`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the find format:**<br>

`ATTRIBUTE_FIELD` can take on the following values
`all`, `avail`, `appstatus`, `course`, `email`, `intstatus`, `name`, `phone`, `seniority`, `studentid`, `remark`

* A candidate's `avail` may match any case variation of days in the format of `MON`, `TUE`, `WED`, `THUR` or `FRI`

</div>

* The keyword search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The attribute field is case-insensitive. e.g. `NAME` is equivalent to `name`
* The search will return a list of all candidates containing any of the specified keyword(s) in the specified attribute field.
* For `f/all`, the search will find keywords across all attribute fields of the candidate records.
* Only full keywords will be matched
  e.g. `k/jane doe f/name` will not match candidates with name `jane koe` or just `jane`
* Candidates matching at least one full keyword (in the specified attribute field) will be returned i.e. OR search,
  e.g. `k/Jane k/Doe f/name` will return candidates with name e.g. `Jane Koe`, `John Doe`
* If multiple `ATTRIBUTE_FIELD`s are provided, only the last field will be used.
* If no `ATTRIBUTE_FIELD` is provided, the search will be conducted across all fields by default.

Examples:
* `find k/Jane f/name` returns candidates with name e.g. `jane` and `jane doe`
* `find k/Computer k/Science f/course` returns candidates with the course field i.e. `computer science` and `computer engineering`

## Processing data

### Saving the data

TAlent Assistant™ data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

TAlent Assistant™ data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/talentassistant.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Caution:**

If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid*, TAlent Assistant™ will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. It
is highly advised that you do not modify the JSON files unless you are aware of what you are doing.

When making changes to a candidate's details in talentassistant.json, the corresponding candidate's details in interviewlist.json (if applicable)
must also be updated. Likewise, if an interview is deleted from interviewlist.json, the interview status of the candidate should be updated according
to your desired outcome (scheduled or not completed).

*Format is considered to be invalid when either one of the JSON files are missing, or if the JSON files are edited to contain duplicate candidates
and/or (conflicting) interviews.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TAlent Assistant™ home folder.
