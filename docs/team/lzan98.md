### Project: TAlent Assistant™

#### Overview ####
TAlent Assistant™ is a **desktop, lightweight and centralized management system** catered to NUS School of Computing professors for managing
the interview scheduling process of candidates applying to be undergraduate Teaching Assistants (TA).
Professors will be able to access the candidates’ application data easily and review their general availability for
scheduling interviews during office hours.
TAlent Assistant™ is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, this application will be able to help you manage all things under the hood of the TA initiative
faster than traditional GUI applications.
