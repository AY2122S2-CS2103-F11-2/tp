### Project: TAlent Assistant™

#### Overview ####
TAlent Assistant™ is a **desktop, lightweight and centralized management system** catered to NUS School of Computing professors for managing
the interview scheduling process of candidates applying to be undergraduate Teaching Assistants (TA). It is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using JavaFX.
