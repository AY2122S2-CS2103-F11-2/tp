### Project: TAlent Assistant™

TAlent Assistant™ is a desktop lightweight and centralized management system catered to professors for managing the
process of hiring undergraduate/graduate Teaching Assistants (TA). They will be able to access the TAs’ application
data easily and review qualifications or availability for scheduling interviews. It is optimized for use via a Command
Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, this
application will be able to help you manage all things under the hood of the TA initiative faster than traditional
GUI applications.
