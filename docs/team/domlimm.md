### Project: TAlent Assistant™

#### Overview ####
TAlent Assistant™ is a **desktop, lightweight and centralized management system** catered to NUS School of Computing professors for managing
the interview scheduling process of candidates applying to be undergraduate Teaching Assistants (TA). It is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Features**:
  * Ideated using a placeholder with randomized colour for each candidate's background photo in the `focusPanel` of the application.
  * Updated application's icon and related refactors i.e. Removing traces of previous project naming conventions.
    * E.g. Updating JSON file to `talentassistant.json` instead of the previous project's `addressbook.json`, updating PDF generator title to our application's name, etc.
    * As an overall to help the team.
  * UI refactors wherever necessary.
    * E.g. Changing of styles i.e. `CSS`.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=domlimm&breakdown=true)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed deadlines and deliverables for the team whenever/wherever necessary.
    * E.g. Briefly: Updating milestones, managing issues on GitHub.
  * Beautified releases' description. 

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Heavy refactors were consistently done to existing features throughout the entire development period of our program.
    * Refactored `model` of our application, specifically the entities. E.g. Introduced new entities.
      * Encompasses writing of the entity, test classes and integrated with application's `model`.
    * Improved existing `add` and `edit` commands with the introduction of new fields to our program based on project direction.
      * Includes writing of unit tests.
    * Removal of unused entities of previous `Person` model from the existing codebase e.g. `tag`, `address`.
    * Refactored `Person` model to `Candidate` model.
      * Updated all relevant/related files and scrap usage of `Person` to meet the team's target user profile.

* **Documentation - User Guide**:
  * Worked on the `add`, `edit` commands.

* **Documentation - Developer Guide**:

* **Team-based tasks**:

  * Updating individual roles.
  * Necessary general code enhancements.
    * Work related to renaming the product.
    * Work related to changing the product's icon.
